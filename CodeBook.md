## CodeBook
The tidy data set resulting from the run_analysis.R pulls together test and training data and the relevant subject and activity metadata from the UCI HAR Dataset. 

measurement: is factor representing each of the collected sensor values. 
avg: shows the average of these values for each subject and activity. 

These variables were generated through the process described in the README file.
